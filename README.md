# python-challenge

## Introduction
This challenge had two parts. The first, PyBank, required a quick analysis of moonthly P&L data. The second, PyPoll, was counting votes for an election.

## Overview
For PyPoll I wrote a program that reads a csv containing a row for months and one for P/L amount, counts the number of months, and calculates the total P/L, average month-to-month change, and the greatest increase and decrease.

For PyPoll my program reads a CSV to count the total cumber of votes, as well as the number of votes for each candidate, then declare a winner.

Both programs print the results to the terminal and write a text file to the analysis folder that corresponds to that program.

## Additional Information 
All code is original, my only references were to my own notes from class and from previous programming knowledge.
